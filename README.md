#**Dynatrace Plugin for Jira**

This plugin is installed in Atlassian Jira to link issues to stored sessions in Dynatrace Application Monitoring.  It has been tested with Jira 7.2.5 and AppMon 6.5

##Configuration

###AppMon Configuration
A user account will need to be created in AppMon to support Jira integration.  It is recommended to create a specific user, group, and role for "REST service accounts" with limited permissions to perform necessary tasks.
The current version of the plugin works against default ports of **443** for the HTTPS REST management port and **9911** for the web dashboards, necessary for some advanced usage coming in a later version.  Please open an issue if you need support for more ports

###Jira Configuration
A **jira-dynatrace-plugin.properties** file will be needed in order to use the plugin, or else it will default to unlikely values (localhost from the Jira box).  Please see **examples/jira-dynatrace-plugin.properties** for usage.  This file will need to be dropped into JIRA_HOME, wherever that may be for your installation.  See https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-locate-jira-home-directory-313466063.html for more info (a little outdated but gives you the gist of how to get there)
 
##Installation
There is nothing to install on the Dynatrace AppMon server, just in Jira.  Install the .jar file using the normal method of Administration -> Plugins.

###Link Session to Ticket

Sessions are linked automatically to tickets, provided the session name matches exactly the ticket key (e.g. APPSUPPORT-2595).  Note that this means that you should not check "append timestamp" when you store a session in Dynatrace.

You can right-click a transaction (PurePath, User Action, or Visit) or group of transactions and choose Sessions â†’ Store Session, or else store an entire timeframe by right clicking on the system profile.  More info:
